To get started, follow the instructions in the README.md file to configure your environment variables and generate build artifacts for Beanstalk. Once you have completed these steps, you'll be ready to start generating content using GPT-3.

This project is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, even for those with little or no programming experience. Whether you're a blogger, social media manager, or just looking to create compelling content, this application is the perfect tool for you. So why wait? Let's get started and start creating amazing content today!

Scribble-AI is an AI-powered writing assistant that generates technical blog posts and "this week I learned" (TWIL) posts. This repository contains the code for the backend API as well as the front-end user interface.
